# Real-Time Traffic Monitoring and Congestion Analysis using MongoDB

## Objective
To demonstrate the key NoSQL features of MongoDB — flexibility, scalability, and document-based storage — through a real-time traffic monitoring and congestion analysis system.

---

## NoSQL Feature Demonstrated

- **Document-Based Data Model:** Stores traffic data (vehicle counts, speed, and timestamps) in flexible JSON-like documents.  
- **Real-Time Updates:** Supports continuous insertion and updates of live traffic feed data.  
- **Horizontal Scalability:** Easily scales across multiple nodes for large-scale city-wide traffic networks.  
- **Aggregation Framework:** Enables efficient querying and analysis of traffic congestion patterns over time.

## Tools and Technologies Used

- **Database:** MongoDB 7.0  
- **Language:** Python  
- **Libraries:** `pymongo`, `matplotlib`, `pandas`, `datetime`  
- **Environment:** macOS (Kaushik’s MacBook Air, M3)
